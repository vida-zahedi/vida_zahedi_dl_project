Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious infection that affects the lungs. It can be caused by various pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi
This project aims to classify chest x-ray images into normal or pneumonia and uses transfer learning using pretrained models such as EfficinetNet and MobileNet to do so.\
